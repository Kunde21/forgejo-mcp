> Spec: Pull Request Comment List Tool
> Created: 2025-09-11

## Overview

Create a new MCP tool pr_comment_list that retrieves comments from a specified Forgejo/Gitea pull request with pagination support, following the established patterns in the codebase to enable AI agents to efficiently access and analyze pull request discussions.

## User Stories

### Pull Request Comment Retrieval

As an AI agent, I want to retrieve comments from a specific pull request, so that I can analyze discussions, understand feedback, and provide context-aware responses about the PR's review process.

### Paginated Comment Access

As an AI agent, I want to access pull request comments with pagination support, so that I can efficiently handle large comment threads and manage memory usage when processing extensive PR discussions.

### Structured Comment Data

As an AI agent, I want to receive pull request comments in a structured format with metadata, so that I can parse and utilize comment information including author, timestamp, content, and pagination details effectively.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pull Request Comment Retrieval** - Implement MCP tool to fetch comments from specified pull requests in Forgejo/Gitea repositories
2. **Pagination Support** - Add pagination capabilities with configurable limit and offset parameters for handling large comment sets
3. **Data Structure Definition** - Create structured data models for pull request comments and response formatting
4. **Validation Layer** - Implement input validation for repository format, pull request numbers, and pagination parameters in the server handler only
5. **Error Handling** - Add comprehensive error handling following existing codebase patterns

## Out of Scope

- Pull request creation or modification
- Comment creation, editing, or deletion
- Pull request merging or status changes
- User authentication or authorization management
- Repository administration operations

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional MCP tool named `pr_comment_list` that successfully retrieves and returns pull request comments with proper pagination
2. Complete test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and validation tests following existing codebase patterns
3. Documentation and examples demonstrating tool usage and integration with AI agent workflows
