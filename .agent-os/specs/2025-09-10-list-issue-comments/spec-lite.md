# Spec Summary (Lite)

Add a list_issue_comments tool to enable programmatic retrieval of all comments from specific issues in Forgejo/Gitea repositories through the MCP interface. This tool complements the existing create_issue_comment functionality by providing read access to issue discussions, supporting use cases like comment history review, automated analysis, and CI/CD integration workflows.
