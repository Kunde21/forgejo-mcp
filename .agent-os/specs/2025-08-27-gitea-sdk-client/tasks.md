## Task Execution Order

1. Start with Client Interface and Core Structure (Tasks 1.1-1.2)
2. Proceed to Gitea SDK Integration (Tasks 2.1-2.2)
3. Implement Request Building and Filtering (Tasks 3.1-3.3)
4. Complete Response Transformation (Tasks 4.1-4.3)
5. Finalize with Integration and Documentation (Tasks 5.1-5.3)
6. Perform Testing and Quality Assurance (Tasks 6.1-6.2)

## Success Criteria

- All tests written before implementation (TDD)
- All tests passing with >80% coverage
- Client interface fully documented
- Integration with existing MCP server verified
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- Error handling comprehensive and tested

## Notes

- Follow TDD strictly: write test first, then implementation
- Each task should result in a passing test suite
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests using minimal mock implementations
- Use real Gitea instance for integration tests only
