# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Project Foundation Setup
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Establish the foundational structure for the forgejo-mcp project including Go module initialization, dependency management, and directory structure. This creates the base framework that enables all subsequent development phases to proceed with a consistent and well-organized codebase.

## User Stories

### Initial Project Setup

As a developer, I want to initialize the Go project with proper module configuration, so that I can manage dependencies effectively and ensure reproducible builds.

The developer will run `go mod init` to create the module, add core dependencies like Cobra for CLI framework and MCP SDK for protocol implementation, and establish the project structure. This ensures a solid foundation with all necessary packages configured correctly from the start.

### Configuration Management

As a developer, I want a structured configuration system, so that I can easily manage different deployment environments and runtime settings.

The configuration system will support loading values from environment variables and config files, with proper validation and type safety. This enables flexible deployment across different environments without code changes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Go Module Initialization** - Set up the Go module with proper naming and initial dependencies for Cobra, MCP SDK, Viper, and Logrus.
2. **Directory Structure Creation** - Establish organized directories for cmd, server, tea, context, auth, config, types, and test packages.
3. **Configuration Management** - Implement a Config struct with loading and validation capabilities for environment variables and config files.
4. **Dependency Management** - Add and verify all required third-party packages with specific versions for consistency.
5. **Basic Project Files** - Create essential files like .gitignore, LICENSE, and initial README documentation.

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of actual CLI commands or server functionality
- Tea CLI wrapper implementation
- Authentication logic
- MCP protocol handling
- Testing implementation beyond structure setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Documentation beyond basic README

## Expected Deliverable

1. A properly initialized Go module with all specified dependencies installed and verified through `go mod tidy`
2. Complete directory structure matching the specification with placeholder files where appropriate
3. Working configuration management system that loads from environment variables and validates required fields
