  - [x] 1.2 Create TestServer struct with cmd, stdin, stdout, ctx, cancel, and t fields
  - [x] 1.3 Implement NewTestServer constructor with proper pipe setup
  - [x] 1.4 Add IsRunning() method to check process status
  - [x] 1.5 Use `t.Cleanup` for proper resource cleanup
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all TestServer tests pass

  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for Initialize() helper method using `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/client`
  - [x] 2.2 Implement Initialize() method for MCP protocol initialization with library client
  - [x] 2.3 Write tests for Start() method

  - [x] 3.6 Implement TestToolDiscovery test function
  - [x] 3.7 Create MCP client using `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/client` in test utilities
  - [x] 3.8 Verify all basic integration tests pass

- [x] 4. Implement Advanced Test Scenarios
  - [x] 4.1 Write tests for tool execution
  - [x] 4.2 Implement TestToolExecution test function
  - [x] 4.3 Write tests for error handling scenarios
  - [x] 4.4 Implement TestErrorHandling test function
  - [x] 4.5 Write tests for concurrent requests
  - [x] 4.6 Implement TestConcurrentRequests test function
  - [x] 4.7 Verify all advanced test scenarios pass

- [x] 5. Integration and Final Verification
  - [x] 5.1 Run complete test suite with `go test ./...`
  - [x] 5.2 Verify all tests pass in CI/CD environment
  - [x] 5.3 Add integration_test.go to project structure
  - [x] 5.4 Update README.md with testing instructions
  - [x] 5.5 Run `go vet ./...` and `goimports -w .` for code quality
  - [x] 5.6 Final verification that all tests pass and code meets standards
