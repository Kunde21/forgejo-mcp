> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Implement TestServer Core Structure
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for TestServer struct initialization and basic properties
  - [ ] 1.2 Create TestServer struct with cmd, stdin, stdout, ctx, cancel, and t fields
  - [ ] 1.3 Implement NewTestServer constructor with proper pipe setup
  - [ ] 1.4 Add IsRunning() method to check process status
  - [ ] 1.5 Use `t.Cleanup` for proper resource cleanup
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify all TestServer tests pass

- [ ] 2. Implement Test Utilities and Helper Methods
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for Initialize() helper method using `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/client`
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement Initialize() method for MCP protocol initialization with library client
  - [ ] 2.3 Write tests for Start() method
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement Start() method to launch server process, use `t.Context` to handle early exit
  - [ ] 2.5 Add timeout and error handling to Start() method
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all test utility tests pass

- [ ] 3. Create Basic Integration Test Scenarios

  - [ ] 3.5 Write tests for tool discovery
  - [ ] 3.6 Implement TestToolDiscovery test function
  - [ ] 3.7 Create MCP client using `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/client` in test utilities
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify all basic integration tests pass

- [ ] 4. Implement Advanced Test Scenarios
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for tool execution
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement TestToolExecution test function
  - [ ] 4.3 Write tests for error handling scenarios
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement TestErrorHandling test function
  - [ ] 4.5 Write tests for concurrent requests
  - [ ] 4.6 Implement TestConcurrentRequests test function
  - [ ] 4.7 Verify all advanced test scenarios pass

- [ ] 5. Integration and Final Verification
  - [ ] 5.1 Run complete test suite with `go test ./...`
  - [ ] 5.2 Verify all tests pass in CI/CD environment
  - [ ] 5.3 Add integration_test.go to project structure
  - [ ] 5.4 Update README.md with testing instructions
  - [ ] 5.5 Run `go vet ./...` and `goimports -w .` for code quality
  - [ ] 5.6 Final verification that all tests pass and code meets standards
