# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a new MCP tool called "list_issues" that connects to Gitea/Forgejo repositories to retrieve and display issues with pagination support. The tool will accept repository name, limit, and offset parameters, authenticate using configured credentials, and return structured issue data including number, title, and status information for AI-assisted development workflows.
