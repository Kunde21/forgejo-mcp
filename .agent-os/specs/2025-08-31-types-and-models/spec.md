# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Types and Models
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Implement comprehensive data types and models for the Forgejo MCP server to standardize data structures for pull requests, issues, and API responses. This feature will ensure type safety, improve code maintainability, and provide a consistent interface for handling Forgejo data throughout the application.

## User Stories

### Type-Safe Data Handling

As a developer integrating with the Forgejo MCP server, I want strongly-typed data models, so that I can confidently work with Forgejo data without runtime type errors.

The developer will use the defined types when implementing handlers and transforming data from the Gitea SDK. All data structures will have proper validation, JSON serialization tags, and helper methods for common operations. This eliminates the need for map[string]interface{} and reduces bugs caused by type mismatches.

### Consistent API Responses

As an AI agent consuming the MCP server, I want standardized response formats, so that I can reliably parse and understand the data returned from tools.

The AI agent will receive responses in a consistent format regardless of the tool being called. Success responses will follow a standard structure with data and metadata, while error responses will provide clear error codes, messages, and context. This consistency enables the agent to handle responses uniformly across all tools.

## Spec Scope

1. **Domain Types** - Create PullRequest and related structures with comprehensive fields for PR data representation
2. **Issue Types** - Implement Issue struct with support for labels, milestones, and assignee information
3. **Response Types** - Define standard MCP response formats for success, error, and paginated results
4. **Validation Methods** - Add validation methods to ensure data integrity before serialization
5. **Helper Functions** - Implement utility functions for common type conversions and transformations

## Out of Scope

- Database persistence layer (types are for API/transport only)
- Complex business logic within types (keep them as data containers)
- Auto-generated code from OpenAPI specs
- Migration tools for type version changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. All type definitions compile without errors and pass validation tests
2. JSON serialization/deserialization works correctly with proper field naming
3. Integration with existing handlers demonstrates type safety improvements
