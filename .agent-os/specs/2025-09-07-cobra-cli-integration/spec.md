# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Cobra CLI Integration
> Created: 2025-09-07

## Overview

Implement a professional command-line interface using the Cobra framework to replace the current simple server startup, enabling better user experience, extensibility, and maintainability for the Forgejo MCP server.

## User Stories

### CLI Power User Experience

As a developer using the Forgejo MCP server, I want to have a professional CLI interface with subcommands, so that I can easily manage server configuration, view version information, and validate setup before starting the server.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User runs `./forgejo-mcp --help` to see available commands
2. User runs `./forgejo-mcp serve --config custom.yaml` to start server with specific config
3. User runs `./forgejo-mcp version` to check current version and build details
4. User runs `./forgejo-mcp config --validate` to test configuration and connectivity

### Server Administrator

As a system administrator deploying the Forgejo MCP server, I want to validate configuration and test connectivity before putting the service into production, so that I can ensure reliable operation and catch configuration issues early.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Admin runs `./forgejo-mcp config --validate` to check all settings
2. System performs connectivity test to Forgejo instance
3. Admin reviews validation results and fixes any issues
4. Admin starts server with confidence using `./forgejo-mcp serve`

## Spec Scope

1. **Root Command Setup** - Initialize Cobra root command with global flags and persistent hooks
2. **Serve Subcommand** - Move current server startup logic to dedicated serve command with server-specific flags
3. **Version Subcommand** - Display version information and build details
4. **Config Subcommand** - Validate configuration and test Forgejo connectivity
5. **Dependency Management** - Add Cobra framework to go.mod and update build process

## Out of Scope

- Changing the core MCP server functionality or protocol implementation
- Modifying existing configuration file format or environment variables
- Adding new MCP tools or handlers beyond current scope
- Implementing interactive configuration wizards
- Adding logging or monitoring subcommands

## Expected Deliverable

1. Professional CLI interface with help system and subcommands accessible via `./forgejo-mcp --help`
2. Server starts successfully with `./forgejo-mcp serve` command maintaining all existing functionality
3. Version information displayed with `./forgejo-mcp version` showing build details
4. Configuration validation working with `./forgejo-mcp config --validate` testing Forgejo connectivity
5. All existing environment variable and config file behavior preserved for backward compatibility
