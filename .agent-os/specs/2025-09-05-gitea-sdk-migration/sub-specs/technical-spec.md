# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-gitea-sdk-migration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-05
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Functionality Details

#### SDK Integration Requirements
- **Direct API Calls**: Replace all `tea` CLI command executions with direct Gitea SDK method calls
- **Authentication Handling**: Implement token-based authentication using Gitea SDK's built-in auth mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Maintain consistent error handling patterns across all SDK interactions
- **Response Parsing**: Handle SDK response objects and convert to application-specific data structures

#### Core Functionality Migration
- **Repository Operations**: Migrate repository creation, listing, and management from CLI to SDK
- **Issue Management**: Convert issue creation, updates, and queries to SDK methods
- **Pull Request Operations**: Implement PR creation, updates, and status checks via SDK
- **User Management**: Handle user authentication and profile operations through SDK

#### Integration Requirements
- **Configuration Compatibility**: Ensure existing configuration files remain compatible
- **API Endpoint Flexibility**: Support both Gitea and Forgejo instances through SDK configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting to respect API constraints
- **Connection Management**: Handle connection pooling and timeout configurations

### Performance Criteria
- **Response Time**: SDK calls should not exceed 2x the response time of equivalent CLI operations
- **Memory Usage**: SDK implementation should maintain similar memory footprint to CLI approach
- **Concurrent Operations**: Support concurrent API calls without degradation
- **Startup Time**: Application initialization should not increase by more than 10% after migration

### Authentication Updates
- **Token Storage**: Secure storage and retrieval of authentication tokens
- **Token Refresh**: Handle token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- **Multi-instance Support**: Support authentication for multiple Gitea/Forgejo instances
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure authentication methods meet security best practices

## Approach

### Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Install Gitea SDK v0.22.0 and update go.mod dependencies
- Create SDK client initialization and configuration structures
- Implement basic authentication handling with token management
- Set up error handling and logging for SDK operations

#### Phase 2: Core Migration
- Replace repository operations (list, create, delete) with SDK calls
- Migrate issue management functionality to SDK methods
- Convert pull request operations to direct API calls
- Update user authentication and profile management

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Implement webhook management through SDK
- Add support for repository branching and merging operations
- Migrate any remaining CLI-dependent features
- Optimize SDK calls for performance and reliability

#### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive test suite for SDK integration
- Performance testing to ensure requirements are met
- Integration testing with existing application workflows
- Documentation updates for new SDK-based implementation

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate functionality in small, testable increments
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API interfaces during transition
- **Testing First**: Implement tests before migrating each component
- **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy changes incrementally to minimize risk

## External Dependencies

### Gitea SDK v0.22.0
- **Version**: v0.22.0
- **Justification**: 
  - Latest stable version with comprehensive API coverage
  - Active maintenance and security updates
  - Full compatibility with Gitea v1.21+ and Forgejo instances
  - Rich feature set including authentication, repositories, issues, and PRs
  - Go-native implementation ensuring performance and reliability
- **Integration**: Direct import and usage in place of CLI command execution
- **Fallback**: CLI commands as fallback during migration transition

### Additional Dependencies
- **go.mod Updates**: Update module dependencies to include Gitea SDK
- **Configuration Libraries**: Potential need for enhanced configuration management
- **Testing Frameworks**: Additional testing utilities for SDK integration testing
