> Spec: Gitea SDK Migration
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate the MCP server from using the tea CLI to directly using the Gitea SDK for improved performance, better error handling, and reduced external dependencies. This migration will modernize the codebase by leveraging the official Gitea SDK instead of shelling out to the tea command-line tool.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Developer Experience
As a developer working on the MCP server, I want to use the Gitea SDK directly instead of the tea CLI so that I can have better error handling and performance when interacting with Gitea repositories.

**Workflow:**
1. Developer makes API calls to Gitea
2. SDK handles authentication and request formatting
3. Response is processed directly in Go without shell execution
4. Errors are properly handled and logged

### User Story 2: System Administrator
As a system administrator deploying the MCP server, I want the server to have fewer external dependencies so that deployment is simpler and more reliable without requiring the tea CLI to be installed.

**Workflow:**
1. Deploy MCP server to production
2. Server starts without tea CLI dependency
3. All Gitea operations work through SDK
4. Monitoring shows improved performance metrics

### User Story 3: API Consumer
As an API consumer of the MCP server, I want consistent and reliable Gitea operations so that my integrations work predictably without intermittent CLI failures.

**Workflow:**
1. Client makes request to MCP server
2. Server processes request using Gitea SDK
3. Response is returned with proper error handling
4. No CLI-related timeouts or failures occur

## Spec Scope

1. **Replace tea CLI calls** with direct Gitea SDK method calls in all handlers
2. **Update authentication** to use SDK's built-in auth mechanisms
3. **Migrate repository operations** (create, read, update, delete) to SDK
4. **Update error handling** to leverage SDK's error types and responses
5. **Remove tea CLI dependency** from go.mod and deployment requirements
6. **Update tests** to mock SDK calls instead of CLI execution
7. **Add SDK configuration** for connection settings and timeouts

## Out of Scope

- Changes to the MCP protocol or server architecture
- Modifications to non-Gitea related functionality
- Updates to the Gitea server itself
- Changes to client-side code or integrations
- Database schema modifications
- UI/UX changes

## Expected Deliverable

- MCP server successfully uses Gitea SDK instead of tea CLI
- All existing tests pass with SDK integration
- No tea CLI dependency in go.mod
- Improved error handling and logging for Gitea operations
- Performance benchmarks showing improvement over CLI approach
- Documentation updated to reflect SDK usage
- Deployment scripts updated to remove tea CLI installation
