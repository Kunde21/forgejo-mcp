> Spec: Serve Command Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the serve command for the MCP server to support both stdio and SSE (Server-Sent Events) transports, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and the Forgejo MCP server. This implementation will provide a robust foundation for MCP protocol compliance while integrating with existing authentication and repository detection capabilities.

## User Stories

As an AI agent developer, I want to connect to the MCP server via stdio transport so that I can execute tools and access repository data directly from my development environment.

As a system administrator, I want to deploy the MCP server with SSE transport support so that I can integrate it with web-based AI platforms and monitoring systems.

As an AI agent developer, I want the server to handle MCP protocol messages correctly so that I can reliably execute repository operations and receive structured responses.

## Spec Scope

- Implementation of stdio transport layer for direct process communication
- Implementation of SSE transport layer for HTTP-based communication
- MCP protocol message parsing and response formatting
- Integration with existing authentication validation
- Integration with repository context detection
- Command-line interface for transport selection
- Error handling and logging for transport operations
- Basic health check endpoints for server monitoring

## Out of Scope

- Web UI for server management
- Advanced monitoring and metrics collection
- Authentication UI flows
- Database connection pooling optimizations
- Advanced caching mechanisms
- Multi-tenant server configurations

## Expected Deliverable

- Functional serve command that starts MCP server on specified port
- Successful stdio transport communication with MCP clients
- Successful SSE transport communication with web clients
- Proper MCP protocol message handling and responses
- Integration tests validating transport switching
- Documentation for deployment and usage
- Error logs demonstrating proper error handling
