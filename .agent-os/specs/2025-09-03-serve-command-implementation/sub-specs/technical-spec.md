# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-serve-command-implementation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-03
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Transport Implementation
- Implement HTTP/HTTPS transport layer for MCP server communication
- Support WebSocket upgrade for bidirectional communication
- Handle connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

### MCP Protocol Compliance
- Adhere to Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification v1.0
- Implement JSON-RPC 2.0 message format for all communications
- Support MCP tool calling, resource access, and sampling capabilities
- Ensure proper message validation and error response formatting

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing Forgejo client for repository operations
- Connect with authentication system for secure access
- Interface with context detection for repository awareness
- Support integration with external tools and services

### Performance Criteria
- Response time under 100ms for simple operations
- Support concurrent connections up to configured limits
- Memory usage optimization for long-running server processes
- Efficient resource cleanup and connection pooling

## Approach

The implementation will follow a modular architecture:

1. **Transport Layer**: HTTP/WebSocket server using existing Go HTTP libraries
2. **Protocol Handler**: MCP protocol implementation with JSON-RPC message processing
3. **Integration Layer**: Adapters for Forgejo client, auth, and context systems
4. **Tool Registry**: Dynamic tool registration and execution framework

All components will leverage existing codebase patterns and maintain compatibility with current authentication and client systems.
