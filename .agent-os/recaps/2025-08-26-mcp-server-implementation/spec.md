> Spec: MCP Server Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the core MCP (Model Context Protocol) server functionality that enables AI agents to interact with Forgejo repositories through standardized tools. This server will handle tool registration, request routing, and integration with the tea CLI to provide PR and issue management capabilities.

## User Stories

### AI Agent Repository Interaction

As an AI agent, I want to connect to the MCP server and query repository data, so that I can analyze and work with Forgejo pull requests and issues programmatically.

The AI agent initializes a connection to the MCP server through stdio transport, authenticates using the configured token, and requests available tools. Once connected, it can call `pr_list` to retrieve pull requests filtered by state, author, or labels, and `issue_list` to get issues with similar filtering options. The server handles these requests by executing tea CLI commands, parsing the output, and returning structured JSON responses that the AI can process.

### Developer Tool Management

As a developer, I want the MCP server to automatically register and manage available tools, so that AI agents can discover and use repository interaction capabilities without manual configuration.

When the server starts, it automatically registers all available tools (pr_list, issue_list) with their parameter schemas and descriptions. AI agents can query the tool manifest to understand what operations are available and what parameters each tool accepts. The server maintains tool versioning and handles graceful degradation if specific tools are unavailable.

## Spec Scope

1. **MCP Server Core** - Server struct with lifecycle management (start/stop) and configuration handling
2. **Transport Layer** - Stdio transport implementation for MCP communication protocol
3. **Tool Registration** - Dynamic tool registration system with manifest generation
4. **Request Handlers** - Tool-specific handlers for pr_list and issue_list operations
5. **Tea CLI Integration** - Wrapper interface for executing tea commands and parsing output

## Out of Scope

- WebSocket or HTTP transport implementations
- Direct API calls to Forgejo (all interactions through tea CLI)
- Tool implementation beyond pr_list and issue_list
- Authentication token generation or management
- Repository creation or modification operations

## Expected Deliverable

1. MCP server starts successfully and accepts stdio connections from AI agents
2. Tool manifest correctly lists pr_list and issue_list with parameter schemas
3. pr_list and issue_list tools return formatted JSON data from tea CLI output
