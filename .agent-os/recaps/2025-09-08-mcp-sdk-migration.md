# Task Completion Recap: MCP SDK Migration

**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Spec:** MCP SDK Migration  
**Status:** Partially Completed ⚠️

## Summary

Successfully migrated the forgejo-mcp server from the third-party `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` SDK to the official `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp` SDK. The migration involved updating all imports, adapting to the official SDK's API, and ensuring all existing MCP tools continue to work without disruption. Core migration tasks have been completed, but testing and documentation phases remain pending.

- **Migration To:** `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp`
- **Key Changes:**
  - Server initialization: `server.NewMCPServer()` → `mcp.NewServer()`
  - Tool registration: `server.AddTool()` → `mcp.AddTool()` with generics
  - Handler signatures: Updated to include typed parameters
  - Result construction: New content-based result format
  - Transport: `server.ServeStdio()` → `server.Run(ctx, &mcp.StdioTransport{})`

## Verification Results

- ✅ Project compiles successfully with new SDK
- ✅ All unit tests updated and passing
- ✅ Integration tests migrated and functional
- ✅ Core server functionality verified
- ✅ Tool handlers working with new signatures

- ⚠️ Documentation updates pending
- ⚠️ Performance validation pending

## Current Status

The core migration implementation is complete and the server is functional with the official MCP SDK. All major code changes have been implemented, and automated tests are passing. However, comprehensive manual testing, documentation updates, and release preparation tasks remain to be completed before the migration can be considered fully finished.

## Next Steps

1. Complete manual testing checklist
2. Perform performance validation
3. Update all documentation
4. Create migration guide for users
5. Prepare for release

The migration provides significant benefits including official support, better protocol compliance, and access to new SDK features while maintaining full backward compatibility for existing functionality.
