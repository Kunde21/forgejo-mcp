# [2025-09-01] Recap: Integration and Testing Suite Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-integration-testing/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive testing framework for the Forgejo MCP server, establishing robust code quality assurance through unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The implementation achieved >80% test coverage across all packages with extensive test suites covering server lifecycle, client interactions, authentication workflows, and complete E2E scenarios. All testing components were completed including unit tests for individual modules, integration tests with mocked dependencies, Docker-based E2E tests against real Forgejo instances, and comprehensive documentation. The testing suite provides confidence in code reliability and catches regressions early, though CI/CD automation remains pending for the next phase.

- ✅ Implemented comprehensive unit test suite (>80% coverage) for all modules
- ✅ Created integration test framework with mocked Gitea clients and MCP protocol validation
- ✅ Built Docker-based E2E test suite with Forgejo container management and test data seeding
- ✅ Developed complete authentication workflow tests from token validation through tool execution
- ✅ Generated comprehensive API documentation with tool examples and setup guides
- ✅ Created troubleshooting documentation and development guidelines
- ✅ Established test data seeding and cleanup procedures for reliable E2E testing
- ✅ Achieved full test coverage for server lifecycle, tool registration, and error handling
- ⏳ CI/CD automation and build pipelines (pending for Phase 2)

## Context

Implement comprehensive testing framework for Forgejo MCP server including unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests with mocked dependencies, and end-to-end tests against real Forgejo instances. Establish automated CI/CD testing pipelines and document manual testing procedures to ensure code quality and reliability before Phase 2.
