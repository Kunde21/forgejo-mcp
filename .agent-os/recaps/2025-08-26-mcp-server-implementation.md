# 2025-08-26 Recap: MCP Server Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-mcp-server-implementation/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI agents to interact with Forgejo repositories through standardized tools. The server provides robust stdio transport, dynamic tool registration, and seamless integration with the tea CLI for PR and issue management capabilities. All components are fully tested with comprehensive integration tests, proper error handling, and structured JSON responses for AI agent consumption.

Key achievements include:
- Complete MCP server core with lifecycle management and configuration handling
- Stdio transport implementation for JSON-RPC message handling over stdin/stdout
- Dynamic tool registration system with manifest generation for pr_list and issue_list tools
- Request handlers with parameter extraction and validation
- Tea CLI integration with command builders, output parsing, and response transformation
- Comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and error scenarios
- Proper logging, timeout handling, and graceful shutdown capabilities

## Context

Implement the core MCP server functionality that enables AI agents to interact with Forgejo repositories through standardized tools. The server handles tool registration, request routing through stdio transport, and integrates with the tea CLI to provide pr_list and issue_list capabilities, returning structured JSON responses for AI agent consumption.
