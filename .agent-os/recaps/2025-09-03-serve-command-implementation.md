# Spec Recap: Serve Command Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the serve command for the MCP server with comprehensive stdio and SSE transport support, enabling seamless AI agent interactions with Forgejo repositories through the Model Context Protocol.

## Completed Features

### ✅ Core Server Implementation
- **MCP Server Creation**: Built using the official MCP Go SDK for protocol compliance
- **Configuration Management**: Integrated with existing config system supporting host, port, and logging settings
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper server startup, graceful shutdown, and signal handling
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health` endpoint for server monitoring and status verification

### ✅ Transport Layer Implementation
- **Stdio Transport**: Direct process communication for local AI agent integration
- **SSE Transport**: HTTP-based Server-Sent Events transport for web-based AI platforms
- **Transport Selection**: Command-line flag support for choosing between stdio and SSE modes
- **Connection Management**: Proper connection lifecycle with timeout handling and error recovery

### ✅ MCP Protocol Integration
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full adherence to MCP v1.0 specification with JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging
- **Tool Registry**: Dynamic tool registration and execution framework
- **Message Handling**: Complete request parsing, validation, and response formatting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with proper MCP error codes

### ✅ Authentication & Security
- **Token Validation**: Integrated with existing authentication system using Gitea SDK
- **Request Authentication**: All tool calls validated against Forgejo API tokens
- **Caching**: Authentication state caching for improved performance
- **Security Headers**: Proper CORS and security headers for SSE transport

### ✅ Repository Integration
- **Context Detection**: Automatic repository context detection from git environment
- **Forgejo Client**: Integration with existing Gitea SDK client for API operations
- **Tool Implementation**: Three core tools implemented:
  - `pr_list`: List pull requests with filtering options
  - `issue_list`: List issues with state and label filtering
  - `context_detect`: Detect repository context from current directory

### ✅ Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all server components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end request/response flow validation
- **Transport Tests**: Both stdio and SSE transport functionality verified
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Various error conditions and edge cases covered
- **Performance Tests**: Concurrent connection handling validated

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between transport, protocol, and business logic layers
- **SDK Integration**: Leveraged official MCP Go SDK for protocol compliance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with existing codebase patterns
- **Extensibility**: Framework ready for additional tools and transports

### Performance & Reliability
- **Concurrent Handling**: Support for multiple simultaneous connections
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and connection pooling
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable read/write timeouts for robustness
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with configurable levels

### Developer Experience
- **CLI Interface**: Intuitive command-line interface with comprehensive help
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration through flags and config files
- **Debugging**: Debug mode with verbose logging for troubleshooting
- **Documentation**: Complete usage examples and deployment guidance

## Key Outcomes

1. **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP v1.0 implementation enabling integration with any MCP-compatible AI agent
2. **Transport Flexibility**: Support for both local (stdio) and remote (SSE) agent connections
3. **Repository Awareness**: Automatic context detection and Forgejo API integration
4. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, error handling, and monitoring capabilities
5. **Extensible Framework**: Clean architecture supporting future tool and transport additions
