> Spec: Gitea SDK Client Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a robust Go client using the official Gitea SDK (code.gitea.io/sdk/gitea) that makes direct API calls to Forgejo repositories, retrieves structured data, and transforms results for the MCP server. This client will provide the core functionality for accessing Forgejo operations through the official API, enabling the MCP server to interact with Forgejo repositories efficiently and reliably.

## User Stories

### MCP Server Tool Handler

As an MCP server tool handler, I want to make direct API calls to Forgejo through a clean Go interface, so that I can retrieve pull request and issue data with optimal performance and reliability.

The tool handler will call methods like `ListPRs()` or `ListIssues()` on the client interface, passing filter parameters. The client will make authenticated HTTP requests to the Forgejo API, handle responses, and return structured Go types that can be easily transformed into MCP responses.

### AI Agent Developer

As an AI agent developer using the MCP server, I want reliable and consistent responses from Forgejo operations, so that my agents can process repository data predictably.

When an AI agent requests a list of pull requests, the MCP server uses the Gitea SDK client to make direct API calls. The client ensures proper authentication, error handling, and response parsing, returning either successful results or meaningful error messages that help the agent understand what went wrong.

## Spec Scope

1. **Client Interface Definition** - Define a clean interface with methods for accessing Forgejo API and retrieving structured data
2. **Gitea SDK Integration** - Integrate the official Gitea SDK with proper client configuration and authentication
3. **API Method Implementation** - Implement methods for listing pull requests and issues with comprehensive filtering
4. **Response Transformation** - Transform Gitea SDK response types to internal types defined in the types package
5. **Error Handling System** - Comprehensive error handling for API failures, authentication issues, and network problems

## Out of Scope

- CLI tool installation and management (using official Gitea SDK instead)
- Command line parsing (direct API calls)
- Process execution management (HTTP client handles this)
- Repository context detection (handled by context package)
- Authentication token management (handled by auth package)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A working Gitea SDK client that can make API calls to `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls` and `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` with various filters
2. Structured Go types returned from client methods that match the types defined in the types package
3. Comprehensive error handling that provides clear feedback when API calls fail or authentication issues occur
