# Task 3 Completion Recap: Refactor MCP Handlers with Dependency Injection

**Date:** 2025-09-06  
**Task:** Refactor MCP Handlers with Dependency Injection  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  

## Summary
Successfully refactored MCP handlers to use dependency injection patterns and integrate with the new `remote/gitea` package. This architectural improvement enhances testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Completed Subtasks

### 1. Refactor handler interfaces and dependencies (Tests First) ✅
- Created comprehensive tests for dependency injection patterns
- Defined clear interfaces between server and remote/gitea packages
- Implemented `HandlerDependencies` struct for centralized dependency management
- Verified dependency injection works correctly with mock implementations

### 2. Split server/sdk_handlers.go into focused files (Implementation) ✅
- Created `server/handlers.go` with refactored MCP handler orchestration
- Created `server/validation.go` for MCP-specific input validation
- Created `server/types.go` for shared types and structures
- Updated all handler structs to use `remote/gitea` dependencies

### 3. Update handler implementations (Verification) ✅
- Modified `SDKPRListHandler` to use `giteasdk.ResolveCWDToRepository` and `giteasdk.ExtractRepositoryMetadata`
- Updated `SDKRepositoryHandler` to use dependency-injected client
- Refactored `SDKIssueListHandler` to integrate with remote/gitea functions
- Ensured all function calls use the new package structure
- Verified functionality preservation through comprehensive testing

## Key Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified:
- **New:** `server/handlers.go` - Refactored handlers with dependency injection
- **New:** `server/validation.go` - MCP-specific validation functions
- **New:** `server/types.go` - Shared types and dependency structures
- **Modified:** All handler implementations to use remote/gitea package

### Architectural Improvements:
- **Dependency Injection:** Handlers now receive dependencies through constructor injection
- **Interface Segregation:** Clear separation between MCP server logic and Gitea SDK operations
- **Testability:** Enhanced testability through mockable interfaces
- **Code Organization:** Better separation of concerns across packages

### Functions Updated:
- `SDKPRListHandler.HandlePRListRequest` - Now uses `giteasdk.ResolveCWDToRepository`
- `SDKRepositoryHandler.ListRepositories` - Uses dependency-injected client
- `SDKIssueListHandler.HandleIssueListRequest` - Integrates with remote/gitea validation
- All validation functions moved to appropriate files with proper imports

## Testing Results
- All existing tests pass with new architecture
- New tests added for dependency injection patterns
- Integration tests confirm no regressions in MCP functionality
- Test coverage maintained above acceptable thresholds

## Impact on Project
- Improved code maintainability through better separation of concerns
- Enhanced testability with dependency injection patterns
- Foundation laid for future extensibility and feature additions
- Cleaner architecture that follows SOLID principles

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Task 4: Update Tests and Ensure Compatibility</content>

Now, to simulate the completion sound, since I can't play audio, I'll use a text-based alert. Let me try to play a sound using aplay if possible, or just echo a message. 

Since the user asked to "play system completion sound", and I have aplay available, let me try to play a short sound. But I need a sound file. Let me check if I can generate a beep or use a system sound. 

Actually, let me just echo a completion message and consider the sound "played" in text form. 

But to be thorough, let me try to use speaker-test to generate a beep. 

Speaker-test is usually available on Linux systems for testing audio. 

Let me try that.
