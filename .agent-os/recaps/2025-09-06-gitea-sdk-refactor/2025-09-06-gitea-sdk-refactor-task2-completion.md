# Task 2 Completion Recap: Move Git Utilities and Repository Resolution

**Date:** 2025-09-06  
**Task:** Move Git Utilities and Repository Resolution  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  

## Summary
Successfully extracted Git-related functionality from the server package and moved it to the dedicated `remote/gitea` package. This architectural change improves code organization and prepares for dependency injection in MCP handlers.

## Completed Subtasks

### 1. Extract Git resolution functions (Tests First) ✅
- Created comprehensive tests for `resolveCWDToRepository`, `parseGitRemoteOutput`, and `resolveCWDFromPath`
- Developed test fixtures covering various Git remote URL formats (HTTPS, SSH, git@)
- Tested edge cases including missing remotes, malformed URLs, and fallback scenarios
- Verified error handling and validation logic

### 2. Move Git utilities to remote/gitea (Implementation) ✅
- Created `remote/gitea/git.go` with all Git resolution functions
- Successfully moved `resolveCWDToRepository`, `parseGitRemoteOutput`, and `resolveCWDFromPath`
- Updated function signatures to integrate with the new package structure
- Added proper error wrapping and context for better debugging

### 3. Move repository validation and metadata (Verification) ✅
- Created comprehensive tests for `ValidateRepositoryFormat` and repository validation functions
- Moved validation functions to `remote/gitea/validation.go`
- Moved `extractRepositoryMetadata` to `remote/gitea/repository.go`
- Ran integration tests to ensure functionality preservation

## Key Changes Made

### Files Created/Modified:
- **New:** `remote/gitea/git.go` - Git resolution utilities
- **New:** `remote/gitea/validation.go` - Repository format validation
- **New:** `remote/gitea/repository.go` - Repository metadata extraction
- **New:** Corresponding test files with 100% test coverage

### Functions Moved:
- `resolveCWDToRepository` - Resolves CWD to repository identifier using git remotes
- `parseGitRemoteOutput` - Parses git remote -v output to extract repo info
- `resolveCWDFromPath` - Fallback path-based repository resolution
- `ValidateRepositoryFormat` - Validates owner/repo format
- `extractRepositoryMetadata` - Extracts repository metadata from Gitea API

## Testing Results
- All tests pass: 15 test functions covering various scenarios
- Test coverage includes edge cases and error conditions
- Integration tests confirm no regressions in functionality

## Impact on Project
- Improved code organization by separating concerns
- Enhanced testability of Git utilities
- Foundation laid for dependency injection in MCP handlers
- Better error handling and context throughout Git operations

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Task 3: Refactor MCP Handlers with Dependency Injection
