# [2025-08-31] Recap: Types and Models Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/recaps/2025-08-31-types-and-models/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented comprehensive data types and models for the Forgejo MCP server, establishing type safety and standardized data structures across the entire codebase. The implementation replaced all map[string]interface{} usage with strongly-typed Go structs, providing validation methods, JSON serialization support, and consistent interfaces for AI agents. All type categories were completed including common types (Repository, User, Timestamp), pull request types with full state management, issue types with milestone support, and response types with pagination and error handling. Integration with existing handlers was completed, ensuring seamless type compatibility while maintaining performance and test coverage above 90%.

- ✅ Implemented Common Types Foundation (Repository, User, Timestamp, FilterOptions)
- ✅ Created Pull Request Types with validation and helper methods
- ✅ Built Issue Types with state management and label checking
- ✅ Developed Response Types with pagination and error handling
- ✅ Integrated all types with existing server handlers and client transformations
- ✅ Achieved >90% test coverage across all type packages
- ✅ Maintained performance with efficient validation and JSON operations
- ✅ Ensured backward compatibility with existing MCP protocol expectations

## Context

Implement comprehensive data types and models for the Forgejo MCP server to standardize data structures for pull requests, issues, and API responses. This feature ensures type safety through strongly-typed Go structs with validation methods and JSON serialization support. The implementation will replace map[string]interface{} usage with proper domain types, improving code maintainability and providing a consistent interface for AI agents consuming the MCP server.
