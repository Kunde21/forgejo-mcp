# 2025-08-26 Recap: Cobra CLI Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-cobra-cli-implementation/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a complete Cobra CLI structure for the forgejo-mcp project, providing a robust command-line interface with root and serve commands, comprehensive global and command-specific flags, proper logging integration, configuration management, and graceful shutdown handling. The implementation includes proper error handling, extensive testing, and full documentation, establishing a solid foundation for the MCP server functionality.

Key achievements include:
- Main entry point with signal handling and graceful shutdown
- Root command with global configuration flags
- Serve command with server-specific options
- Integrated logging with logrus and configurable levels
- Configuration loading with environment variable and file support
- Comprehensive test coverage and validation
- Complete documentation and help text

## Context

Implement a robust command-line interface using the Cobra framework to provide the primary entry point for the forgejo-mcp server with structured commands, global flags for configuration and logging, and proper signal handling for graceful shutdown. This CLI foundation enables users to start and configure the MCP server through intuitive commands like `forgejo-mcp serve` with comprehensive flag-based configuration options.
