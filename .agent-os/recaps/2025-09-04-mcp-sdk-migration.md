# [2025-09-04] Recap: MCP SDK Migration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-04-mcp-sdk-migration/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully migrated the forgejo-mcp project from a hybrid MCP implementation to the official MCP SDK, achieving full protocol compliance while eliminating approximately 2000+ lines of custom MCP server code. The migration preserved all existing Forgejo integration functionality including PR listing, issue operations, and tea CLI integration, while significantly reducing maintenance overhead through standardized SDK components.

- ✅ Removed all custom MCP server components (server.go, mcp_server.go, transport.go, tools.go)
- ✅ Updated command layer to use pure MCP SDK server initialization
- ✅ Consolidated tool handlers to use MCP SDK CallToolRequest/CallToolResult types
- ✅ Integrated authentication with MCP SDK middleware approach
- ✅ Cleaned up dependencies and validated MCP protocol compliance
- ✅ All existing tests updated and passing with new SDK architecture
- ✅ Verified all Forgejo tools work identically to pre-migration functionality

## Context

Replace the current hybrid MCP implementation with the official MCP SDK to ensure full protocol compliance and reduce maintenance overhead. This migration will eliminate ~2000+ lines of custom MCP server code while preserving all existing Forgejo integration functionality, enabling easier maintenance and automatic protocol updates through the official SDK.
