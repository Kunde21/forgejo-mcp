# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-integration-testing/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Unit Testing Framework
- Use Go's built-in testing package with table-driven test patterns
- Implement test fixtures and helpers for common test scenarios  
- Mock external dependencies using interfaces and test doubles
- Use testify/assert for more expressive assertions
- Generate coverage reports using `go test -cover`

### Integration Testing Architecture
- Create test harness for MCP server lifecycle management
- Implement mock Gitea client with configurable responses
- Use httptest for simulating HTTP interactions
- Test JSON-RPC message handling over stdio transport
- Verify tool registration and manifest generation

### End-to-End Testing Setup
- Configure test Forgejo instance using Docker containers
- Implement test data seeding for repositories, PRs, and issues
- Create test authentication tokens with various permission levels
- Automate test environment setup and teardown
- Implement retry logic for flaky network operations

### Coverage and Reporting
- Enforce minimum 80% code coverage per package
- Generate HTML coverage reports for visual analysis
- Integrate coverage reporting with CI/CD pipelines
- Track coverage trends over time
- Identify untested code paths and edge cases

### Documentation Standards
- Use godoc format for all exported functions and types
- Include example code snippets in documentation
- Create README files for each major package
- Document test execution commands and options
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues

## External Dependencies

- **github.com/stretchr/testify** - Enhanced assertions and test suite management
- **Justification:** Provides more readable test assertions and better error messages than standard library
- **github.com/golang/mock** - Mock generation for interfaces  
- **Justification:** Enables creation of test doubles for complex dependencies
- **github.com/ory/dockertest** - Docker container management for E2E tests
- **Justification:** Simplifies setup and teardown of test Forgejo instances
