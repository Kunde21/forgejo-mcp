# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Integration and Testing Suite
> Created: 2025-09-01

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing framework for the Forgejo MCP server that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This will ensure code quality, catch regressions early, and provide confidence in the reliability of all Phase 1 features before moving to Phase 2.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Workflow

As a developer, I want to run comprehensive tests on the Forgejo MCP server, so that I can ensure code quality and catch bugs before deployment.

The developer should be able to run unit tests for individual components (server, client, context, auth modules), execute integration tests that verify component interactions with mocked dependencies, and run end-to-end tests against a real Forgejo instance. The testing suite should provide clear feedback on failures, generate coverage reports showing which code paths are tested, and integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.

### Continuous Integration

As a DevOps engineer, I want automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, so that every code change is validated before merging.

The CI system should automatically trigger on pull requests and commits, run the full test suite including unit, integration, and E2E tests, generate coverage reports with minimum thresholds enforcement, and block merges if tests fail or coverage drops below 80%. The system should provide detailed failure logs and suggestions for fixing issues.

### Manual Testing Documentation

As a QA engineer, I want clear documentation of manual testing procedures, so that I can verify functionality that cannot be automated.

The documentation should outline step-by-step procedures for testing MCP tool interactions, authentication flows with various token types, error handling scenarios, and performance under load. Each procedure should include expected outcomes, common failure modes, and troubleshooting steps.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unit Test Suite** - Comprehensive unit tests for server, client, context, and auth modules with minimum 80% code coverage
2. **Integration Test Framework** - Tests for MCP server lifecycle, tool registration, and handler execution with mocked Gitea clients
3. **End-to-End Test Suite** - Complete workflow tests against a test Forgejo instance covering authentication, context detection, and tool execution
4. **Test Documentation** - API documentation, setup guides, and development documentation with testing procedures
5. **Coverage Reporting** - Code coverage analysis with reporting and enforcement of minimum thresholds

## Out of Scope

- Performance benchmarking beyond basic load testing
- Security penetration testing
- Cross-platform GUI testing
- Stress testing with thousands of concurrent connections
- Automated UI/UX testing

## Expected Deliverable

1. All existing tests pass with >80% code coverage across all packages
2. New test files created for untested modules (server_test.go, client_test.go, context_test.go, auth_test.go)
3. Integration tests successfully validate MCP server startup, tool registration, and basic tool execution
4. E2E tests demonstrate complete workflow from authentication through tool execution
5. Comprehensive documentation exists for API usage, setup procedures, and development guidelines
