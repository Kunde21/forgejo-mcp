# [2025-09-05] Recap: Repository-Based Listing Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-repository-based-listing/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the core repository-based listing functionality, transforming the MCP server from user-centric to repository-centric data retrieval. Completed comprehensive testing infrastructure and core validation logic, with API handlers updated to support repository parameters instead of user identifiers. The implementation enables AI systems to efficiently access targeted project information and maintain focused context for repository-specific analysis.

- ✅ **Repository Parameter Validation Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite covering repository format validation, existence checking, access permissions, and edge cases
- ✅ **API Handler Tests**: Implemented tests for updated PR and issue list handlers with repository parameters, including CWD resolution and parameter precedence
- ✅ **Response Format Tests**: Developed tests for updated response formats with repository metadata and backward compatibility
- ✅ **Repository Parameter Validation**: Added repository format validation, existence checking via Gitea API, access permission validation, and CWD-to-repository resolution
- ✅ **API Handlers Update**: Modified PR and issue list handlers to use repository-based filtering, updated query builders, and implemented proper JOIN operations for repository data

## Context

Transform repository data retrieval from user-centric to repository-centric queries, enabling AI systems to efficiently access targeted project information and maintain focused context for repository-specific analysis and automation. This change supports precise repository-focused data retrieval for AI context optimization and eliminates user-based data noise by providing project-centric insights.

## Next Steps

Remaining tasks include updating response models with repository metadata, modifying SDK client methods for repository parameters, comprehensive integration testing, documentation updates, and final verification and cleanup.
