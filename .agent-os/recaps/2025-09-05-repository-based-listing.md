# 2025-09-05 Recap: Repository-Based Listing Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-repository-based-listing/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented core repository-based listing functionality for pull requests and issues, transforming the MCP server from user-centric to repository-centric data retrieval. The implementation includes comprehensive parameter validation, updated API handlers, and SDK client modifications to support repository-specific queries.

Key achievements include:
- Repository parameter validation with format checking and access permissions
- Updated PR and issue list handlers to accept repository identifiers
- Comprehensive test coverage for validation logic and API endpoints
- SDK client updates to support repository parameters
- Database query modifications for repository-based filtering
- Response format updates with repository metadata inclusion
- Proper error handling for repository access and validation scenarios

Completed Tasks:
- ✅ **Repository Parameter Validation Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite covering repository format validation, existence checking, access permissions, and edge cases
- ✅ **API Handler Tests**: Implemented tests for updated PR and issue list handlers with repository parameters, including CWD resolution and parameter precedence
- ✅ **Response Format Tests**: Developed tests for updated response formats with repository metadata and backward compatibility
- ✅ **Repository Parameter Validation**: Added repository format validation, existence checking via Gitea API, access permission validation, and CWD-to-repository resolution
- ✅ **API Handlers Update**: Modified PR and issue list handlers to use repository-based filtering, updated query builders, and implemented proper JOIN operations for repository data
- ✅ **Response Models and Formatting Update**: Updated response structures to include repository metadata, modified JSON marshaling, and ensured format consistency
- ✅ **SDK Client Methods Update**: Modified MCP SDK client to support repository parameters with updated method signatures and parameter validation

## Context

Transform repository data retrieval from user-centric to repository-centric queries, enabling AI systems to efficiently access targeted project information and maintain focused context for repository-specific analysis and automation. This implementation enables precise repository-focused data retrieval for AI context optimization, supports targeted project analysis by querying repository-specific PRs and issues, and improves AI efficiency by eliminating user-based data noise and providing project-centric insights.

The implementation covers the core functionality changes including repository parameter integration, query logic updates, authentication/authorization enhancements, and response format consistency, with comprehensive testing and SDK compatibility updates.

## Next Steps

Remaining tasks include comprehensive integration and end-to-end testing, documentation updates, and final verification and cleanup.
