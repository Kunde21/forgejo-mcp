# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement comprehensive data types and models for the Forgejo MCP server to standardize data structures for pull requests, issues, and API responses. This feature ensures type safety through strongly-typed Go structs with validation methods and JSON serialization support. The implementation will replace map[string]interface{} usage with proper domain types, improving code maintainability and providing a consistent interface for AI agents consuming the MCP server.
