# [2025-08-26] Recap: Project Foundation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/recap/2025-08-26-project-foundation/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully established the complete foundational structure for the forgejo-mcp project, creating a solid base framework that enables all subsequent development phases. The implementation included Go module initialization with all core dependencies (Cobra CLI framework, MCP SDK, Viper configuration, and Logrus logging), a well-organized directory structure with all required packages, comprehensive configuration management system with environment variable and file support, structured logging infrastructure, and thorough test coverage. All project verification steps passed including static analysis, dependency checks, and test execution, resulting in a production-ready foundation with proper documentation and metadata files.

- ✅ Go module initialized with core dependencies (Cobra, MCP SDK, Viper, Logrus)
- ✅ Organized directory structure with all packages (cmd, server, tea, context, auth, config, types, test)
- ✅ Configuration management system with validation and multi-source loading
- ✅ Logging infrastructure with configurable levels and structured output
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering all core functionality
- ✅ Project documentation including README, API docs, and configuration examples
- ✅ All verification steps passed (go vet, go test, dependency checks)

## Context

Establish the foundational structure for the forgejo-mcp project including Go module initialization with core dependencies (Cobra, MCP SDK, Viper, Logrus), organized directory structure, and configuration management system. This creates the base framework with proper dependency management and project organization that enables all subsequent development phases to proceed consistently.
