# Spec Summary (Lite)

Consolidate input validation by removing duplicate validation between server and service layers, keeping all validation in server handlers using inline ozzo-validation patterns. This will eliminate maintenance overhead, achieve cleaner separation of concerns, and improve code maintainability while preserving existing validation logic and error handling.
