# [2025-09-05] Recap: Gitea SDK Migration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-gitea-sdk-migration/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully migrated the forgejo-mcp project to use the official Gitea SDK v0.22.0, replacing all tea CLI command executions with direct API calls for improved performance, reliability, and maintainability. The migration eliminated CLI dependencies while preserving all existing Forgejo integration functionality including PR operations, issue management, and repository handling.

- ✅ **SDK Dependencies and Setup**: Added Gitea SDK v0.22.0 to go.mod with proper import path verification, implemented SDK client factory with token-based authentication, and created comprehensive configuration tests
- ✅ **Core Handler Migration**: Replaced TeaPRListHandler and TeaIssueListHandler with SDK-based implementations, migrated repository operations to direct API calls, and implemented robust error handling
- ✅ **Error Handling and Response Transformation**: Created SDK error wrapper with context preservation, implemented response transformers for PR/issue/repository data, and added authentication failure handling and recovery
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure Migration**: Updated test suite to use SDK mocks instead of CLI mocks, created comprehensive SDK mocks for all operations, and implemented performance comparison tests
- ✅ **Cleanup and Validation**: Removed all tea CLI imports and references, cleaned up go.mod dependencies, executed full test suite and performance benchmarks, and updated documentation

## Context

Migrate the forgejo-mcp project to use an updated Gitea SDK implementation that provides better performance, enhanced API features, and improved error handling for more reliable Git operations. Key objectives included upgrading to the latest SDK version for improved compatibility and security, enhancing API reliability with better error handling and retry mechanisms, and reducing technical debt through modernized SDK integration patterns.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Integration
- **Direct API Calls**: Replaced all `tea` CLI command executions with direct Gitea SDK method calls
- **Authentication**: Implemented token-based authentication using SDK's built-in auth mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Maintained consistent error handling patterns across all SDK interactions
- **Response Parsing**: Handled SDK response objects and converted to application-specific data structures

### Core Functionality Migration
- **Repository Operations**: Migrated repository listing, creation, and management from CLI to SDK
- **Issue Management**: Converted issue queries and operations to SDK methods
- **Pull Request Operations**: Implemented PR listing and status checks via SDK
- **Response Transformation**: Created transformers to convert SDK responses to MCP format

### Testing and Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all SDK handlers with mock implementations
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real SDK calls and performance benchmarks
- **Performance Validation**: Verified SDK calls meet performance requirements (< 2x CLI response time)
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed all tea CLI dependencies and updated go.mod

## Results

The migration successfully achieved all objectives:
- **Performance**: SDK implementation shows improved response times and reduced memory footprint
- **Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms for more robust API interactions
- **Maintainability**: Eliminated CLI dependencies, reducing technical debt and maintenance overhead
- **Compatibility**: Maintained full backward compatibility with existing MCP API contracts
- **Security**: Upgraded to latest SDK version with current security patches and improvements
