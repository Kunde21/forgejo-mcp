# [2025-09-05] Recap: Gitea SDK Migration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-gitea-sdk-migration/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully migrated the forgejo-mcp project from tea CLI-based operations to direct Gitea SDK integration, achieving improved performance, enhanced error handling, and reduced external dependencies. The migration modernized the codebase by replacing all CLI command executions with native SDK method calls while maintaining full compatibility with existing MCP server functionality.

- ✅ **SDK Dependencies and Setup**: Added Gitea SDK v0.22.0 with comprehensive testing and authentication
- ✅ **Core Handler Migration**: Replaced all tea CLI handlers with SDK-based implementations for PRs, issues, and repositories
- ✅ **Error Handling and Response Transformation**: Implemented robust SDK error handling and MCP response formatting
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure Migration**: Updated test suite to use SDK mocks instead of CLI command mocking
- ✅ **Cleanup and Validation**: Removed tea CLI dependencies and validated complete migration with full test coverage

## Context

Migrate the forgejo-mcp project to use an updated Gitea SDK implementation that provides better performance, enhanced API features, and improved error handling for more reliable Git operations. Key improvements include upgrading to latest SDK version for improved compatibility and security, enhancing API reliability with better error handling and retry mechanisms, and reducing technical debt through modernized SDK integration patterns.
