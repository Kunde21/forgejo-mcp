# PR List Implementation Recap

> **Date:** 2025-09-11  
> **Feature:** Pull Request Listing Tool  
> **Status:** ✅ Complete  
> **Roadmap Phase:** Phase 3: Expanded Repository Interactions  

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `pr_list` MCP tool for listing pull requests in Forgejo/Gitea repositories. The implementation follows the established architectural patterns and provides comprehensive functionality for AI agents to retrieve pull request information with filtering and pagination capabilities.

## Initial Goal Context

**From spec-lite.md:** Add a new MCP tool "pr_list" to list pull requests in Forgejo/Gitea repositories, following the same patterns as the existing issue_list functionality. The tool will support filtering by state (open/closed/all) and include pagination with limit/offset parameters.

**Key Requirements:**
- New MCP tool "pr_list" for listing pull requests in repositories
- Parameters: repository (required), limit (optional, default 15), offset (optional, default 0), state (optional, default "open")
- Follows existing architectural patterns with interface, client, service, and handler layers
- Uses ozzo-validation for input validation and proper error handling
- Integrates with existing MCP server registration and Forgejo client patterns
- Includes comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Delivered
- **Pull Request Listing**: Complete implementation of pull request retrieval from Forgejo/Gitea repositories
- **State Filtering**: Support for filtering PRs by state (open, closed, all)
- **Pagination**: Full pagination support with configurable limit (1-100) and offset parameters
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using ozzo-validation library
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with proper context and user-friendly messages

### Architecture Layers
1. **Interface Layer**: Added `PullRequest` struct and `ListPullRequestsOptions` with proper type definitions
2. **Client Layer**: Implemented `ListPullRequests` method using Gitea SDK with repository parsing
3. **Service Layer**: Added business logic with validation and error handling
4. **Handler Layer**: Created `handlePullRequestList` function with MCP integration
5. **Server Integration**: Registered `pr_list` tool with the MCP server

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Complete coverage of all layers (interface, client, service, handler)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing with real API scenarios
- **Mock Server Tests**: Comprehensive mock server support for testing without live instances
- **Acceptance Tests**: Real-world scenario validation and edge case handling
- **Validation Tests**: All input validation scenarios and error conditions

## Roadmap Alignment

This implementation satisfies the **"Pull Request listing functionality"** requirement in **Phase 3: Expanded Repository Interactions** of the product roadmap. The feature enables AI agents to:

- ✅ List pull requests from repositories
- ✅ Filter by PR state (open/closed/all)  
- ✅ Handle pagination for repositories with many PRs
- ✅ Follow consistent patterns with existing tools

**Note:** The roadmap item has been marked as complete [x], and this implementation fully satisfies the success criteria for Phase 3.

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
- Follows established Go coding standards and project conventions
- Consistent error handling patterns across all layers
- Proper separation of concerns with clean architecture
- Comprehensive documentation with godoc comments

### Integration
- Seamless integration with existing MCP server infrastructure
- Consistent with existing tools (issue_list, issue_comment_*)
- Proper tool registration and schema definition
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Performance
- Efficient pagination handling for large repositories
- Optimized API calls with proper parameter handling
- Graceful error recovery and fallback mechanisms

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **AI agents can list PRs**: Full implementation with comprehensive filtering and pagination  
✅ **Consistent architecture**: Follows established patterns from existing tools  
✅ **Comprehensive testing**: All test categories passing with high coverage  
✅ **Production ready**: Proper validation, error handling, and documentation  
✅ **Roadmap alignment**: Satisfies Phase 3 requirements completely  

## Next Steps

The PR List implementation completes the core functionality for Phase 3. Remaining items in this phase include:
- PR comment viewing functionality (future implementation)

This successful implementation establishes a solid foundation for future pull request management features in Phase 4 and beyond.
