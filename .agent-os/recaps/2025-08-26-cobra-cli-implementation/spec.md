> Spec: Cobra CLI Implementation  
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a robust command-line interface using the Cobra framework to provide the primary entry point for the forgejo-mcp server. This CLI structure will enable users to start the MCP server, configure logging levels, and manage the application through well-structured commands with proper flag handling and signal management.

## User Stories

### Command Line User

As a developer using forgejo-mcp, I want to start the MCP server with a simple command, so that I can integrate Forgejo functionality into my AI-powered development workflow.

The user runs `forgejo-mcp serve` to start the MCP server, which initializes with default settings or uses custom configuration through flags like `--config`, `--debug`, and `--log-level`. The server starts up with proper logging output showing the initialization status and remains running until receiving a shutdown signal, at which point it performs graceful cleanup.

### Configuration Manager

As a system administrator, I want to configure the forgejo-mcp server behavior through command-line flags and configuration files, so that I can adapt it to different deployment environments.

The administrator can specify a custom configuration file with `--config /path/to/config.yaml`, set debugging mode with `--debug`, or adjust logging verbosity with `--log-level info`. These settings override defaults and provide flexibility for various deployment scenarios from development to production.

## Spec Scope

1. **Root Command Structure** - Initialize the main Cobra application with global flags for configuration, debugging, and logging control
2. **Server Command Implementation** - Create the `serve` subcommand with specific flags for host and port configuration
3. **Main Entry Point** - Implement the executable entry point with proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
4. **Logging Integration** - Configure Logrus logging based on command-line flags with appropriate formatters and levels
5. **Command Documentation** - Add comprehensive help text, usage examples, and command aliases

## Out of Scope

- MCP server implementation details (handled in separate spec)
- Tea CLI wrapper functionality
- Authentication and repository context detection
- Actual tool implementations (PR list, issue list)
- Database or API implementations

## Expected Deliverable

1. A working CLI that starts with `forgejo-mcp` and shows help information
2. The `forgejo-mcp serve` command successfully initializes and waits for connections
3. Proper shutdown handling when receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM signals
