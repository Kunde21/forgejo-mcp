## üîê Authentication Validation Requirements Clarification

### 1. Token Sources & Priority

What are the supported authentication token sources and their priority order?

‚Ä¢ Environment variables (FORGEJO_TOKEN)
‚Ä¢ Configuration files
‚Ä¢ Command-line parameters
‚Ä¢ Other sources?

### 2. Validation Methods

How should tokens be validated?

‚Ä¢ Direct API calls to Forgejo instance
‚Ä¢ Using tea CLI validation
‚Ä¢ Both methods with fallback
‚Ä¢ Cached validation results

### 3. Security Requirements

What are the security requirements for token handling?

‚Ä¢ Token encryption at rest
‚Ä¢ Token masking in logs
‚Ä¢ Token expiration handling
‚Ä¢ Invalid token cleanup

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

How should authentication failures be communicated?

‚Ä¢ Clear error messages for different failure types
‚Ä¢ Retry mechanisms for temporary failures
‚Ä¢ Graceful degradation when auth fails

### 5. Integration Points

Where should authentication validation be integrated?

‚Ä¢ MCP server startup
‚Ä¢ Individual tool execution
‚Ä¢ Repository context detection
‚Ä¢ All of the above

### 6. Performance Considerations

What are the performance requirements?

‚Ä¢ Validation frequency (per request, cached, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Timeout limits for validation calls
‚Ä¢ Concurrent validation handling

Please provide guidance on these requirements so I can create a comprehensive and secure authentication validation specification.
